 <h3 style="color: white">Kabulue kazadi Mak was born in the commune of Goma in North-Kivu (in the Democratic Republic of Congo) on May 17, 1996. Very early on, the young Cogolais became passionate about music and dance and taught himself the guitar, the piano and the trumpet. .

This multi-instrumentalist also takes some drum lessons, the first instrument that his parents offer him when he is only 6 years old.

At the age of 12, Makiavene Kazadi decided to go to a local singing competition, the "Amani Leo", even though he never took any singing lessons. Makiavene Kazadi is second in the competition against more experienced singers.

 

YouTube's dedication
Makiavene Kazadi's mother, Liberata, then decided to post the video of the contest so that all the family and all the friends absent on the day of the event could benefit from this feat.

In 2007, she created a Youtube channel on her son and continues to post clips of songs reinterpreted by Makiavene, like "life to zero" of ferre gola.

 

A heading from the net
It is thus through the internet and these "amateur videos" that Patrick, the marketing director of So So Def, discovers Makiavene Kazadi. The professional, who becomes the agent of Makiavene, immediately scents the potential of the teenager and organizes a meeting in Kinshasa with Fally Ipupa.<h3>
